# FlashCards

## Abstract

In this command-line quiz, the user is prompted, selects an answer to each question in a series of questions, and given feedback based on their response.

This is the first solo project of Mod 2 of the Front-End program at Turing School. The project was designed by [Turing School Staff](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html) and implemented by me, [Alice Ruppert](https://github.com/srslie).

My goals were to learn to write tests, implement a dynamic program without a front-end (using only the command line and module-exports), use a linter on my code, and follow a guide to create this functionality in the span of only a few days.

## Functionality

You're prompted for each question, given the opportunity to select an answer, and then given feedback. You're able to play through the entire deck of cards:

## Support & Future Iterations

For any technical issues, please contact [Alice](mailto:aliceruppert@gmail.com). 

No future iterations are planned, but to make this more exciting, more cards could be added. There could be a way for users to upload their own questions and answers for studying or trivia purposes. There could be a way to score and record scores between plays or users. There could be a snazzier front-end display or online deployment.

For now though, enjoy the simple flashcards!
